Vibe checking takes you to my spotify playlist "Vibe Check" which updates with 5 new songs based on recommendations from the 5 artists entered
previously.
It's a fun playlist that is always full of surprises and a good indicator of how I've felt at different moments in time when I updated the playlist!
